# Selenium Grid profiles: There is one profile here for every OS/browser
# combination supported by the PNNL Selenium Grid.
#
# You can use the script bin/behat_grid to run your tests using all of
# these profiles in parallel. The "SeleniumGrid" annotation is the key to this
# behavior - add that annotation to a profile to have it run together with the
# other profiles, or remove it to prevent it from being tested.
#
# It is, of course, always possible to test using any single profile just by
# calling "vendor/bin/behat --config=behat_selenium_grid.yml -profile=<profile_name>"
