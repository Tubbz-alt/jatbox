# hub: Checks whether Selenium Server is already running on this machine in
# hub mode, and starts it if not. You shouldn't ever need to start this script
# manually, because it is run when bin/behat is run.
#
# This is the script that needs to run on the MASTER machine (the Vagrant VM),
# see ../node for the script the needs to run on the SLAVE machine
